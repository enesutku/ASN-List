An ASN list is a collection of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) that are associated with a particular organization, country, or region. They can be used for network analysis, threat intelligence, research, and compliance. There are different types of ASN lists, including organization, country, regional, and threat intelligence lists. ASN lists can provide valuable insights into network infrastructure, traffic patterns, and potential cyber threats.
